      doubt that anyone besides you would have been creative enough to come up with

      strong enough to do that to us! Maybe individually, sure. Especially the weaklings
      of the team like Black and Blue. And yeah, I guess you and Yellow could be
      subdued by a strong masculine criminal. Now Green and I, that would be a little
      trickier. I know Green is strong enough to destroy a large number of goons,
      I am capable of doing that too. Hmmm. Maybe Green was the muscle of this joke
      operation."
