    text: I agree, Blue. I was able to detect what seemed to be the silhouette of
      a person behind that glass.

    text: Quite impressive, I must say. Either you must have a perfect 20/20 vision
      or your sense of sight is heightened by the adrenaline rush given our circumstances.

    text: "I will take that as a compliment, since I really don\u2019t think adrenaline
      has kicked in yet. And let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t. I must say though,
      this does feel very different from any other situation we have been in. Something
      doesn\u2019t feel right."

    text: I agree. To think that someone would be able to capture the six of us,
      and not only that, but to do it around the same time. That would require enormous
      skill and preparation. The time window surely was narrow.

      see anything else."

      they can provide some feedback and we could get to a solution sooner.

      not sound like a good plan either. Besides, what makes you think there could
      be an impostor?

      us?
