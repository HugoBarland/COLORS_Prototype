      Are you insane? There are windows, which you see through them. And then there

      total garbage. I will show you what a true analysis sounds like."

      no, not an act, an attack! From our most deceiving enemy. Doctor Tyrano Spear.
      I have studied his movements for weeks, no, months! And I have come to the
      conclusion, scientific conclusion, that this guy is the most sneaky threat
      we have ever faced! He is probably the one behind all this and when I present
      this theory to Red, I know he will agree! He will probably promote me to be
      the new right hand man. What do you say?"
