      that will help us get out of this place?

    text: I have been performing some calculations at a faster rate than normal.
      And I have noticed all this situation seems very unusual when compared to our
      previous experiences with the criminal type.

    text: The abilities of whoever was able to apprehend the 6 of us, must surely
      be out of the charts. That is, assuming this individual is exactly that. An

      that I was paired with you. It\u2019s good to know a little of your thought
      process on all this. And to be honest I was a little concerned. As you said,
      all this seems a little unusual when compared to everything we have faced in
      the past."
