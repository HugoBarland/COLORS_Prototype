    text: "I had a weird feeling about that window too. And I\u2019ll be honest with
      you Blue, all this seems a little odd. To think that someone would be able
      to capture the six of us. Not one, but the six of us."

    text: But why the need to observe us behind that window? If this person is so
      skilled, why not simply end us right there where he captured us.

    text: I have not collected enough data to come up with an answer to that, Miss
      Pink, but I am strongly inclined to believe that if we are still alive, the
      person or persons behind all this must really be familiar with our routines.
      Not only that, but all this must be really personal for them.

      this information with you it\u2019s because I have full trust in you, but I

      piece of information with anybody. Not until I think it\u2019s safe."

    text: Suspecting that someone within the staff of the organization could be behind
      all this is very reasonable. After all, they are aware of all our movements,
      weaknesses and routines. However, I know the organization. I know their surveillance
      practices from top to bottom since I helped design the system and the foundation
      of everything that rules it.

    text: But we wear the colors for a reason, and even if some of the members seemed
      to not have been enlightened with the gift of intelligence, they still wear
      the colors for a reason. They have proven themselves to be capable of performing
      tasks that the general public could only dream of achieving.

    text: As I said to you before, Miss Pink. I need you to keep this between us
      for safety. I shared it because I see you as my friend, and because I am confident
      enough that your mind could now focus on things that I may ignored. I need
      you to trust me.
